# %pomodoro - A ToyÂ Agent

We include a simple agent to illustrate some tests. %pomodoro is a prototype productivity agent which mock-emits a signal every 25 seconds (in real Pomodoro terms, minutes) and then every 5 seconds (minutes) in alternating intervals to a list of watchers. (We avoid calling these "subscribers" since that has a special meaning in Urbit; it would be compatible with a slight tweak of this demo but requires a testnet or livenet.)
